Type of Test Mining : 
Stop Word Removal 
Tokenisation
Stemming
Lematisation
POS
NER


Which technique help to find root word of a word : 
Lematisation and Steming

Stemming is faster than Lematisation . 
Lematisation is slow because it always refers to in built dictionary 
Stemming is faster because it only focusses on suffixes of word 

What is tokenisation 
breaking down large amount of texts into manageable texts OR splitting sentence into words
sentence tokenizer : separate document into sentences
word tokenization : paragraph broken into words

Very imp : input text is tokenized 

What is stop word removal ?
Removing common words which do not contribute anything to analysis like : the is am 
Why : for faster processing 

Library in Python : NLTK : Natural Language toolkit

What is POS tagging : mapping words to part of speech . it tries to identify part of speech like noun , verb

NER : It is about finding the type of noun we are looking for .

Before NER tagging , first tokenize and then POS tagging then NER comes
